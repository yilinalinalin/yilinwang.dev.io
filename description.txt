This website serves as a collection of my creative coding projects, which aim to present my coding skills to others. It contains a brief self-introduction and several links to my other social media accounts, such as LinkedIn, GitHub, my design website, and so on. For the main content, the website has projects and tools. There will be 6 projects that can best show my coding skills. The “tools” section displays the coding languages, frameworks, and design software that I know. In the individual project page, it contains project briefs, introduction videos, and process documentation.
